      <p>Hi, I'm Josh! üêù</p>
      <p>
        In 2023 I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Software Engineering. In May 2025 I will graduate with my Master's degree in Molecular Science and Software Engineering at UC Berkeley. I have an academic background in chemical engineering, computer science, and software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        My published research includes combustion simulation software, as well as human-computer interaction studies. I did the simulation paper with the BYU Chemical Engineering Department, and the HCI papers with the BYU Social Technology and Privacy Lab. I also worked on other projects in the STaPL including prototypes for neurodiverse inclusive social platform features. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At BYU I worked on a capstone project with a company creating a new, web-based app for processing payroll files. I designed a node-based pipeline system which was capable of handling the different needs of different clients. Integrating this app and deploying it was very rewarding.
