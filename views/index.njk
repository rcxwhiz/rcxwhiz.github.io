                <p>Hi, I'm Josh! üêù</p>
                <p>
                    In 2023 I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in computer science & software engineering, and in August 2024 I will be starting my Master's in molecular science and software engineering at UC Berkeley. I have an academic background in chemical engineering, computer science, and software engineering.

                    My published research (linked on my resume) includes combustion simulation software, as well as multiple human-computer interaction studies. I worked on these HCI studies in the BYU STaPL (Social Technology and Privacy Lab), where I also developed prototypes for neurodiverse-friendly social platforms.

                    This website, beyond just being something to, essentially hosts post-mortems of projects that I thought were interesting, and maybe you will too.
